{"body":"Sorting\r\n=======\r\n\r\nComparison of various sorting algorithms.\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n`sorting` is a simple modular program that debugs various sorting algorithms in order to spot advantages and drawbacks of each one. It consists of a main program, `sorting.c`, which executes the various algorithms while keeping track of many operations and resource usage.\r\n\r\nIt currently displays:\r\n* time,\r\n* comparisons,\r\n* swappings,\r\n* writes,\r\n* recursion depth,\r\n* space,\r\n* memory allocations.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms implemented are divided in two groups depending on their performances:\r\n* fast:\r\n  + comb_sort,\r\n  + heap_sort,\r\n  + merge_sort,\r\n  + quick_sort,\r\n  + quick_fast_sort,\r\n  + shell_sort,\r\n  + ciura_shell_sort;\r\n* slow:\r\n  + bubble_sort,\r\n  + cocktail_sort,\r\n  + gnome_sort,\r\n  + insertion_sort,\r\n  + selection_sort.\r\n\r\n`sorting` performs sorting on different types of arrays in order to emphasize different characteristics of the algorithms (shuch as adaptiveness).\r\n\r\nIt currently sorts arrays of *length - type*:\r\n* 5000 - decreasing,\r\n* 15000 - decreasing,\r\n* 25000 - decreasing,\r\n* 5000 - almost sorted,\r\n* 15000 - almost sorted,\r\n* 25000 - almost sorted,\r\n* 5000 - random,\r\n* 25000 - random,\r\n* 50000 - random,\r\n* 100000 - random,\r\n* 300000 - random,\r\n* 500000 - random.\r\n","name":"Sorting","tagline":"Comparison of various sorting algorithms","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
